# Gossip App

## Instructions

The user journey is as follows: on this great social network, a user will sign up, provide their first and last name, email and age, and then specify their city with a search by postal code.

They will then have all the features that will make this app a future Bitchin'Tech unicorn:

* Users can create gossip: "I heard John is single hihi"
* Users, when creating gossip, can add one or more tags to the gossip: #romance
* Users can comment on gossip: "ahiii I didn't know lol üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
* And since your app must respect industry standards, it will also be possible to comment on comments
* Users can like gossip
* Users can contact their favorite gossips via DM to get world exclusives
* The user can search for gossip by city, user, date (most recent or oldest), number of likes, tags, to find the juiciest gossip
